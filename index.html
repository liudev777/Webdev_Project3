      This is my project 1 website. Here you can find links to my resume as well as an about me section that talks about my hobbies and stuff. I need this page to be longer so I guess I will talk about pineapples, because I like pineapples.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The pineapple is a spiky yellow house that a sponge lives in. But did you you it is also an edible fruit?

    <h2>Fun fact <strong>Disclaimer: I don't know how true these facts are, I didn't do a fact check</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Pineapple contains an enzyme (Bromelain?) that digests protein. It can be used as meat tenderizer in certain dishes. Therefore, when you eat a raw unprocessed pineapple, it is actually also eating you back (Newtowns 3rd law?).
    </p>
    <p>
      To prevent this, soak your pineapple in salt water before consuming.
